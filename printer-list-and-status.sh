#---------DESCRIPTION--------
# When used as a geeklet, it shows the current status of all printers
# If paused, they show up in red
# If idle, they show up in green
# 
# If the special characters (red and green status icons) do not appear, you may need to adjust the file encoding to UTF8
# You can also drag and drop other emoji from the OS X Character Viewer, but the ones I have here work well

#----------VARIABLES---------
# Colors
end="\x1b[0m"
bold="\x1b[001m"
underscore="\x1b[004m"
red="\x1b[031m"
green="\x1b[032m"

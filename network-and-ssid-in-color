#---------DESCRIPTION--------
	# Shows the current SSID that the computer is connected to
	# Shows the current IP for both wired and wireless interfaces
	#
	# This is most useful in an enterprise environment because you can set the desired wireless network
	# The desired network will show up in green text (meaning it is good)
	# If it connects to a different network (such as a guest network) the text will turn red
	#
	# In addition, if there is no ethernet cable plugged in, the text will turn red

#-----------USAGE------------
	# To run: 
	#
	#		0. Paste the entire script into a geeklet 	 
	#		1. Choose a refresh time
	#		2. Adjust the tab spaces to make it look nice
	#			--try using a fixed-width font for best results
	
#----------VARIABLES---------
	# These variables are to give the text color, which makes the scripts more useful
	# At a glance, you can tell if the system is in good shape (green), has a minor problem (yellow), or needs immediate attention (red)
	# The end variable is required to show where the coloring should end
	# An example would be if you only wanted one word to be color, that word would need to end with the $end variable
	# See more colors and options here:
	# http://www.csc.uvic.ca/~sae/seng265/fall04/tips/s265s047-tips/bash-using-colors.html
	#
	# If the colors are not working, try changing any echo commands to printf. 
	# If you make this change, you will also need to add a \n to the end of the commands so it goes to a newline
	# If you want to use echo, make sure the #!/bin/bash is not the first line and then echos will print the colors just fine

	# Set your desired network name here.  This is the network that will show in green text
	# If the current network does not match this, it will show as red text

	# grep using case insensitivity and extended regex for the words Wi-Fi or Airport
	wifiOrAirport=$(/usr/sbin/networksetup -listallnetworkservices | grep -Ei '(Wi-Fi|AirPort)')

	# Determine what the wireless device interface number is
	# awk out Wi-Fi or Airport name and the word Device |

	# cut using whitespace as the delimiter, printing the second field
	wirelessDevice=$(/usr/sbin/networksetup -listallhardwareports | awk "/$wifiOrAirport/,/Device/" | awk 'NR==2' | cut -d " " -f 2)
	
	# Determine what the wired device interface number is
	# grep one line following a match to the word Port: Ethernet |
	# sed silently, search for Device | 
	# awk the second field only

#---------DESCRIPTION--------
	# When used as a geeklet, it shows the current status of all printers
	# If paused, they show up in red
	# If idle, they show up in green
	# 
	# If the special characters (red and green status icons) do not appear, you may need to adjust the file encoding to UTF8
 	# You can also drag and drop other emoji from the OS X Character Viewer, but the ones I have here work well
 	
#-----------USAGE------------
	# To run: 
	#
	#		0. Paste the entire script into a geeklet 	 
	#		1. Choose a refresh time
	#		2. Adjust the tab spaces to make it look nice
	#			--try using a fixed-width font for best results


#----------VARIABLES---------
	# These variables are to give the text color, which makes the scripts more useful
	# At a glance, you can tell if the system is in good shape (green), has a minor problem (yellow), or needs immediate attention (red)
	# The end variable is required to show where the coloring should end
	# An example would be if you only wanted one word to be color, that word would need to end with the $end variable
	# See more colors and options here:
	# http://www.csc.uvic.ca/~sae/seng265/fall04/tips/s265s047-tips/bash-using-colors.html
	#
	# If the colors are not working, try changing any echo commands to printf. 
	# If you make this change, you will also need to add a \n to the end of the commands so it goes to a newline
	# If you want to use echo, make sure the #!/bin/bash is not the first line and then echos will print the colors just fine

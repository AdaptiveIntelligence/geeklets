## How it Works
Each script is meant to be run as a separate geeklet.  Most are useful for "walk-by" information gathering.  The color codes quickly allow you to see if something is not correct. 
## Requirements
0. OS X 10.6-10.9
1. [GeekTool 3.1.1](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/)
2. [Geeklet QuickLook Plugin](http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/geeklets/system/quick-look-plugin-for-geektool-geeklet-files-1/) (Optional, but helpful when installing new geeklets)

## Usage 
0. Start a new geeklet for each script--Note: leave off `#!/bin/bash` if you want colors to work with echo, otherwise, you need to change all the echos to `printf`
1. Adjust the refresh rate, size, and font as desired
